Assignment Description:

This submission follows directly from what we discussed in W4D2 class. 

Steps:
1. Create a JSON data file for your project domain.
2. Load or paste it into a variable.
3. Build buttons and sections to display filtered views.
4. Dynamically style and summarize data.
Primarly goal of this assignment is to build dashboard relevant to your project. You could do several things as a part of this dashboard like:

Add buttons: Show All, Filter, Summary, and others… (at least 5 different feature options)
Display data in different <div> sections (by id) ... (at least 5 sections)
Use map/filter/reduce to generate different views — think which views are relevant to your project. (best case scenario, all of them!)
Change color/style based on values; e.g., if (item.rating>8) el.style.color='green'; — at this point you should be able to do more than that! (at least 5 different changes)
This will make up 5X4 = 20 points of the submission. In addition, I expect a quick reflection summarizing what all you did in this submission. This will be 1 page pdf that starts with the basics about your project, a url where i can check your progress hosted online, and the reflection. This will make up the rest 10 points.
