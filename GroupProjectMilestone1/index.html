            <h3>Presented by Teja, Simon, and Aaron</h3>

            <p>This project will cover U.S Accident data. Various views will be avaliable, allowing the user to sort, show all, filter, summarize, and limit the visible rows of data. In the future, 
                data visualization will be an important part of our project. We will create a heat map that shows crashes per region per month, and the ability to move around in time, seeing the heat map adjust dynamically.
                We will also allow the user to adjust the data to simulate changes in accident trends, adding, deleting, or updating data. <br>
                Our data is from 2016-2023 and sourced from Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents/data">us-accidents/data</a> <br>
                Listed below is the json format for each tuple, each tuple will have 46 columns/variables.</p>
